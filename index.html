        This website started as an idea when I was a freshman in college taking my first <a href="https://lsa.umich.edu/women"> Women's Studies</a> class. Now as a junior, I finally have the skill set to make it happen. Growing up in a small, rural, conservative town, this class was really my first introduction to feminism and feminist thought, and I wanted to share my new found knowledge with others. To me, this looked like a website where a lot of feminist things could be compiled in one place, purely because people might not otherwise know about it. My hometown may not have been forward thinking, but we did have internet connection.

        This website currently contains 3 pages other than this one: <br/>
        <span>Literature</span> - featuring books written by women and for women, books and essays about feminism, poems, plays, and bios of female writers. <br/>
        <span>History / Politics</span> - featuring bios and links to websites of important women in history and current women in Congress or otherwise politically involved. <br/>
        <span>Feminist Dictionary</span> - featuring a collection of important feminist terminology that might make reading easier. These will include formal definitions and my own understandings of the terms. <br/>
        <!-- <span>Academics</span> - featuring important women in the past and present in academia, women trailblazers in STEM fields, and Women's Studies courses here at the University of Michigan. <br/> -->
      </p>
      <p>
        <span>DISCLAIMER:</span> I do not know everything!! I'm only human - I'm still growing and learning and I have a limited knowledge of things, but I will do my best and work to make this page as inclusive and unbiased as possible.
